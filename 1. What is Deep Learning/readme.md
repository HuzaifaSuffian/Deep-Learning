****What is Deep Learning?****

It is a subfield of machine learning in which the algorithms are inspired by human brain instead of statistics. Deep learning algorithms attempts to draw similar conclusions as humans would by continually analyzing data with a given called Neural Network.

****Representation Learning:****

            In simple words, representation learning is extracting of features automatically from data instead of human intervention. Suppose if we want to create a Dog/Cat classifier. We have to give features manually like size, color, face patterns etc. but in deep learning the features are extracted automatically.

****Deep Learning Vs Machine Learning****

1.    ****Data Dependency:**** Deep Learning is data hungry, it means with the increase in data its performance improves. On the other hand, Machine Learning performance stabilizes and does not improve with addition of data.

2.    ****Hardware Dependency:**** Machine Learning model works with CPU and Deep learning models works with GPU. It means Deep Learning is hardware costly.

3.    ****Training Time:**** Training time is very slow but prediction time is fast in Deep learning.

4.    ****Feature Selection:**** Feature selection happens automatically in Deep learning.

5.    ****Interpretability:**** Deep Learning model are not interpretable which means if we give it to classify a dog it will do it but do not tell why or how it classified it as dog. In some cases, we need interpretability for that we might need to use Machine Learning.

****Why Deep Learning is famous currently?****

The reasons of Deep Learning popularity are:

1.    ****Datasets:**** After 2012 with the ubiquity of smartphones and internet a lot of data has been generated and it is growing exponentially. The data was unlabeled, so big companies labelled the data. Few examples of label data are

a.    Microsoft Coco (Image) à Millions of labelled images

b.    YouTube 8M (Video) à 6.1 Million videos

c.     Square (Text) à 150,000 question and answers from Wikipedia.

d.    Google Audioset (Audio) à 2 Million sound clips

2.    ****Hardware:**** Hardware is the second reason for Deep Learning popularity because we need to perform complex matrix operation. Here we need heavy hardware. Some of famous hardware are CPU, GPU, NPU, TPU

3.    ****Framework/Libraries:**** These libraries stops us from writing code from scratch. There are 2 famous frameworks that are 1) Transflow + Keras (Industry application) and 2) Pytorch (Research)

4.    ****Architectures:**** There are different architectures and finding best architecture is difficult and expensive. There are existing architectures which we can use like

a.    Image Classification à ResNet

b.    Text Classification à BERT

c.     Image Segmentation à UNet

d.    Image Translation à Pix2Pix

e.    Object Detection à YOLO

f.      Speech Generation à WaveNet

5.    ****People/Community:**** AI community including researchers, teachers, students and Kaggle community help grow Deep Learning progress.
